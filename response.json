    "answer": "For the Jan 2025 batch, you should use the `gpt-4o-mini` model via Anand sir's AI Proxy instead of directly using the OpenAI API. The context states that for this batch, API keys were created to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`, and it specifically advises to \"Use AI Proxy instead of OpenAI.\" To calculate the cost for the given text as asked in the question, you would send a request to the AI Proxy using `gpt-4o-mini` to get the number of input tokens, and then apply the cost rate of 50 cents per million input tokens for the `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` model as specified in the question.",
